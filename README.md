This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Bridge - React Native & LNExtensionExecutor


## LNExtensionExecutor
An extension executor for iOS, allowing bypass of `UIActivityViewController` to execute both UI and non-UI action extensions directly.
